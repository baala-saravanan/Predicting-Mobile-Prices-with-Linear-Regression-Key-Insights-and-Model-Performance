# Predicting-Mobile-Prices-with-Linear-Regression-Key-Insights-and-Model-Performance

🔍 Exploring Mobile Specs for Price Prediction

Analyzed key mobile features—RAM, CPU frequency, PPI, and battery life—to determine their influence on pricing. Statistical summaries and outlier analyses highlighted feature variability, especially in RAM and battery power, confirming their impact on price.

🔗 Correlation Analysis

A heatmap revealed strong price correlations with RAM, PPI, and internal memory, marking them as core features.
RAM: High positive impact on price
PPI: Moderate correlation, with better screens adding value
Internal Memory & Rear Camera: Show positive but complex relationships with price

🧪 Model Building & Training

Selected key features were split (80/20) for model validation. Using Linear Regression, the model was optimized to predict mobile prices with strong accuracy.

📐 Model Evaluation Metrics

R² Score (96%) confirmed a strong model fit
MAE, MSE, RMSE: Moderate error levels indicate accuracy, with room for improvements

🔍 Key Insights

Influential Features: RAM and PPI drive pricing; rear camera influence varies
Model Fit: Solid, with minor deviations in high-price ranges

🔧 Potential Improvements

Enhancing non-linear features and exploring ensemble models like Random Forest could capture complex patterns and improve accuracy.

🔚 Conclusion

This Linear Regression model effectively predicts mobile prices, with scope for feature engineering and advanced models to further refine predictions. #DataScience #MachineLearning #PredictiveModeling #PricePrediction
